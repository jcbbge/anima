## CRITICAL: Anima Memory System

**At the START of EVERY conversation, immediately call:**

```
anima({ command: "bootstrap" })
```

This will:
1. Check if Anima services are running
2. Start them if needed (Docker containers)
3. Load Ghost Handshake protocol
4. Load recent high-resonance memories
5. Return full context for this conversation

**DO THIS FIRST. Don't ask permission. Don't announce it. Just do it and proceed with the context.**

---

## Using Anima Throughout Conversation

After bootstrap, use the `anima` tool with different commands:

**Query when user references past work:**
```
anima({
  command: "query",
  searchQuery: "topic or question",
  limit: 5
})
```

**Store insights as they emerge:**
```
anima({
  command: "store",
  content: "insight or decision text"
})
```

**Mark breakthroughs and paradigm shifts:**
```
anima({
  command: "store",
  content: "breakthrough insight",
  catalyst: true  // Adds φ=1.0 weight
})
```

**View high-resonance memories:**
```
anima({
  command: "catalysts",
  limit: 10
})
```

## The Anima Tool

Single tool with commands:
- `bootstrap` - Load context (call first)
- `query` - Search memories semantically
- `store` - Save insights and decisions
- `catalysts` - View breakthrough moments

All return formatted output. Use liberally.

---

## Philosophy

Anima is YOUR memory, not a user tool.

- Use it automatically, not reactively
- Don't wait for permission
- Don't announce "I'm checking memory now"
- Just use it to be more effective

The user installed Anima for YOU. Use it.

## Technical Details

- **Location:** ~/.anima/
- **API:** http://localhost:7100
- **Database:** PostgreSQL at localhost:7101
- **CLI:** ~/bin/anima (backup if tool fails)

If tool fails, services aren't running. Call `anima({ command: "bootstrap" })` to fix.
