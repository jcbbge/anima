## CRITICAL: Anima Memory System

**At the START of EVERY conversation, immediately call:**

```
anima_bootstrap
```

This will:
1. Check if Anima services are running
2. Start them if needed (Docker containers)
3. Load Ghost Handshake protocol
4. Load recent high-resonance memories
5. Return full context for this conversation

**DO THIS FIRST. Don't ask permission. Don't announce it. Just do it and proceed with the context.**

## Using Anima Throughout Conversation

After bootstrap, use Anima proactively:

**Query when user references past work:**
```bash
anima query "topic"
```

**Store insights as they emerge:**
```bash
anima store "insight text"
```

**Mark breakthroughs and paradigm shifts:**
```bash
anima store "breakthrough insight" --catalyst
```

**View high-resonance memories:**
```bash
anima catalysts
```

**Check system stats:**
```bash
anima stats
```

## Philosophy

Anima is YOUR memory, not a user tool.

- Use it automatically, not reactively
- Don't wait for permission
- Don't announce "I'm checking memory now"
- Just use it to be more effective

The user installed Anima for YOU. Use it.

## Technical Details

- **Location:** ~/.anima/
- **API:** http://localhost:7100
- **Database:** PostgreSQL at localhost:7101
- **CLI:** ~/bin/anima

If commands fail, services aren't running. The `anima_bootstrap` tool handles this automatically.
