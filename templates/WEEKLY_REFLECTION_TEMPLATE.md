## Example Reflection

## Week 1: 2026-01-02 to 2026-01-09

**Generated:** 2026-01-09

---

## Summary Statistics

**Conversations:** 8  
**Avg Context Quality:** 7.5/10  
**Avg Continuity:** 6.8/10  
**Emergence Moments:** 4  
**Manual Interventions:** 3

---

## Highlights

### What Went Really Well

- System excelled at maintaining context within same-day conversations
- Bootstrap was particularly effective for technical debugging threads
- Made 2 surprising connections between past architecture decisions and current work

### Surprising Observations

- System remembered a design constraint I'd forgotten about from 4 days ago
- Query effectiveness improved noticeably toward end of week

---

## Lowlights

### What Struggled

- Multi-day gaps caused some context loss (continuity dropped to 5-6)
- Had difficulty with parallel threads about different topics
- Bootstrap sometimes loaded too much irrelevant context

### Repeated Friction Points

- Needed manual context additions when switching between projects
- Categories not specific enough for my usage patterns

---

## Patterns Noticed

### Usage Patterns

- **Most useful scenarios:** Single-day threads on technical topics
- **Least useful scenarios:** High-level strategic discussions
- **Query patterns:** Specific technical queries worked better than broad questions

### Quality Patterns

- **Context quality trend:** Improving (started at 7, ended at 8)
- **Continuity trend:** Stable (around 6-7)
- **Best thread types:** Code debugging and architecture discussions

### System Behavior

- Memory formation seems to favor concrete technical details over abstract concepts
- Association network growing steadily (2-3 new per day)

---

## Questions Raised

- How can I improve continuity across multi-day gaps?
- Should I be more explicit about starting/ending threads?
- Are my categories too broad?

---

## Changes to Try Next Week

### Adjustments

- Be more deliberate about storing key decisions as memories
- Try explicit "thread start" and "thread end" markers

### Experiments

- Test query effectiveness with different phrasing styles
- Try a longer multi-day thread to see if continuity improves with practice

---

## Notes for V2

### Critical Needs

- Better handling of parallel threads (explicit thread management?)
- More sophisticated bootstrap that adapts to conversation type

### Nice-to-Haves

- Ability to see which memories are being used in bootstrap
- Suggested queries based on current context
